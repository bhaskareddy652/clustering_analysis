This project involves the analysis of a global development measurement dataset to create clusters based on various economic and development metrics of different countries. The goal of this project is to provide a segmentation of countries based on critical indicators and gain insights for economic development strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on several economic and development metrics for various countries around the world. Below is a list of variables present in the dataset:

1.Birth Rate: Birth rate per 1,000 people.

2.Business Tax: Corporate tax rates in each country.

3.CO2 Emissions: CO2 emissions (in metric tons per capita).

4.Country: Name of the country.

5.Days to Start Business: Number of days required to start a business in each country.

6.Ease of Business: Ease of doing business index (higher score means easier business environment).

7.Energy Usage: Total energy consumption per capita (in kWh).

8.GDP: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.

9.Health Expenditure (% of GDP): Percentage of GDP spent on healthcare.

10.Health Expenditure (per capita): Health expenditure per capita in USD.

11.Hours to Do Tax: Number of hours required to comply with tax regulations.

12.Infant Mortality: Infant mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births).

13.Internet Usage: Percentage of the population with internet access.

14.Lending Rate: Interest rate charged by banks on loans.

15.Life Expectancy (Female): Average life expectancy for females in years.

## Conclusion

Analyzed global development measurement data to create meaningful clusters of countries based on 
economic and development metrics, providing insights into social-economic similarities and 
disparities.
